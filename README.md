# Superstore Diwali Sales EDA

## Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Diwali sales data of a Superstore. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we aimed to uncover significant business insights to drive strategic decisions.

## Key Insights
Through our analysis, we discovered that married women aged 26-35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, are more likely to purchase products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization

## Data Cleaning
We performed comprehensive data cleaning to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis. This included handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.

## Visualizations
We created various visualizations to explore the data from different perspectives, including:
- Gender
- Income group
- State
- Profession
- Marital status
- Age

Additionally, we visualized the top products in each category and identified the overall top 10 products sold during Diwali.

## Conclusion
Our findings provided actionable recommendations for targeting key customer demographics and optimizing product offerings in the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.
